The openzeppelin {AccessControl} and {AccessControlEnumerable} contracts uses RBAC (role based access control).

==== AccessControl contract

* Roles are bytes32 hash digest and supports hierarchal role management.
* Each role has role admin and set of members.
* The role admin can add members `{grantRole}`, remove members `{revokeRole}`.
* The members can call remove themselves from the role `{renonunceRole}`.
* By default, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is the role `admin` for all roles and for DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
itself.

* we can set contract deployer as member of DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE in constructor.
 So, the contract deployer can add other members to
 DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (in case the admin needs to changed).
* we can change admin role for other roles using `{_setupRoleAdmin}` method.

==== AccessControlEnumerable contract

Inherits AccessControl and allows enumerating the members of each role.

==== ElvCmnRoles contract

Contains library {ElvCmnRoles} contains user and group roles definition.

```
user roles :
USER_SEE_ROLE
USER_ACCESS_ROLE
USER_EDIT_ROLE
GROUP_ROLE => members are group contract address

group roles :
GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE
GROUP_USER_SEE_ROLE
GROUP_USER_ACCESS_ROLE
GROUP_USER_EDIT_ROLE
```


==== ElvGroup contract

* ElvGroup contract creates and manages group permisssions. The group consists of manager, users with see, access, edit permissions.
* The contract deployer is set as DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE in the constructor. The roles admin hierarchy is set as below:

```
// `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is admin role for `GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE` and
// `GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE` is admin role for `GROUP_USER_SEE_ROLE`,
// `GROUP_USER_ACCESS_ROLE`, `GROUP_USER_EDIT_ROLE`
_setRoleAdmin(ElvCmnRoles.GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE);
_setRoleAdmin(
   ElvCmnRoles.GROUP_USER_SEE_ROLE, ElvCmnRoles.GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE
);
_setRoleAdmin(
  ElvCmnRoles.GROUP_USER_ACCESS_ROLE, ElvCmnRoles.GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE
);
_setRoleAdmin(
  ElvCmnRoles.GROUP_USER_EDIT_ROLE, ElvCmnRoles.GROUP_MANAGER_ROLE
);`

```

==== ElvAccess contract

* ElvAccess contract manages permissions for indiviual and group users.
* For indiviual users, it inherits {AccessControlEnumerable} contract method to grant role, revoke role or to check if it as the provided role.
* For group users, the group contract address are added as member to {GROUP_ROLE} role and the group contract manages the grant role, revoke role or to check if it as the provided role.
* {hasGroupRole} method checks if the account provided is member of the list of group address (which are members of GROUP_ROLE) and returns the corresponding user's role (it can be any of GROUP_* roles).


=== ElvContent contract

* ElvContent contract inherits ElvAccess contract.
* It has method like `getOwnerAddr()` and `updateRequest()` to test permissions.
* `getOwnerAddr()` can be run by individual user with `USER_SEE_ROLE` or `GROUP_USER_SEE_ROLE`
* `updateRequest()` can be run by individual user with `USER_EDIT_ROLE` or `GROUP_USER_EDIT_ROLE`
* tests are at link:../test/ElvContent.t.sol[here]

*Note:* As of now, these contracts will be created by externally owned accounts. It checks if `msg.sender` is `tx.origin` when deploying. Since, we set the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to msg.sender.
